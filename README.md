> An Interactive Particle-Life Simulation using raylib

Particle life is a computational simulation that models the behavior of particles interacting according to specific rules. This concept is often used in the context of artificial life or digital organisms, where particles can represent simple agents or entities that follow predefined interaction rules to exhibit complex, emergent behavior. The concept is built upon ideas from cellular automata, physics, and biology.
